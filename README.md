- Hi, I’m @futuresurf. I’m interested in theories of consciousness, mathematics, choreography and surfing
- I’m currently learning all sorts of things and looking to collaborate on multivarious projects
- Including creating a codified open source surf coaching methodology that everyone can contribute too through github.
- How to reach me: future@iarom.org or through github.
