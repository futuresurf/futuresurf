- 👋 Hi, I’m @futuresurf
- 👀 I’m interested in theories of consciousness, mathematics, choreography and surfing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all sorts of things
- I’m looking to collaborate on multivarious projects, including creating a codified open source surf coaching methodology that everyone can contribute too through github.
- How to reach me: future@iarom.org or through github.
