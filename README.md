- Hi, I’m @zbyyt. I’m interested in theories of consciousness, math, choreography and surf performance
- I’m currently learning all sorts of things and looking to collaborate on multivarious projects
- Including creating a future codified open source surf coaching methodology that everyone can contribute too through github.
- Reach out at future@iarom.org or through github.
